                <h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
                    <p>I was born May 26th, 2000, and I 
                    was born here in Fresno, California. 
                    I have many hobbies, including 
                    playing guitar, playing ukulele, 
                    playing piano, singing, playing video 
                    games, skating, playing football,
                    drawing, video/photo editing, photography, 
                    coding, and 
                    writing.</p>
                    <p>My father’s name is William Blalock. 
                    He is 49, turning 50 in December. My 
                    mother’s name is Lisa Ward, and she is 47.  
                    I have two half-brothers, named Dylan and 
                    Julian. They are 23 and 22 years old. 
                    I also have a half-sister name Kryscynthia, 
                    who is 26 years old. My parents are divorced, 
                    and I live with my father. My mom was 
                    married to a man before my father, and 
                    had my sister and two brothers. Now after 
                    the divorce of my parents, Julian and 
                    Kryscynthia live with my mother, and Dylan 
                    lives in Fresno. My dream vacation would 
                    be a trip to Italy. I love the culture and 
                    architecture and feel that it would be an 
                    absolutely amazing learning opportunity a 
                    long with a fun trip. The same goes for a 
                    place I would like to visit. I would love 
                    to go to Italy. But if it has to be different, 
                    I would say perhaps Oregon and Maine. They 
                    seem like such beautiful states that are 
                    definitely worth a trip.</p>
                <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
                    <h3>Long Term Goals</h3>
                        <p>My first long term goal is to accomplish 
                        starting my own business. I want to own and 
                        run a business that I started after going 
                        to this school.</p>
                        <p>My second long term goal is to go to a 
                        college that is good for majoring in 
                        technology/coding or pyschology. I have 
                        always been interested in the way the 
                        mind works but I also have a new found 
                        love for coding.</p>

                        <p>My first short term goal is to end 
                        this year with at least a 3.5 GPA, 
                        but hopefully I can achieve a 4.0.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, I would like to paricipate 
                        more by joining more clubs, and working 
                        with my teachers and the school to make 
                        this a great environment for everybody.</p>
